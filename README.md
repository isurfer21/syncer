### Description
To ease the workflow, we have developed the **syncer** tool that could make a copy of *cloned repository* in your local working directory, so that your *working repository* could be separated from the *cloned repository* that is used for reference and final code commit. 

Thus, you would be able to,

 - **Synchronise** the *cloned repository* with your *working repository* before starting new task or at your will.
 - **Reverse synchronise** your *working repository* with the *cloned repository* when task gets completed or at your will.

#### Compatible with
 - Windows, macOS, Linux

#### Terminologies used
 - **Cloned repository** &rarr; It refers to git repository that is cloned from remote branch
 - **Working repository** &rarr; It refers to git repository that is local *working repository* based on *cloned repository*
